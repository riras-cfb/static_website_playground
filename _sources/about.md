# About

> The Automation Team at CfB / DTU Biosustain is embedded in the Biofoundry. We strive to improve scientific outcomes for all researchers at the center by by automating the most manual, repetitive and time-consuming workflows in the lab. The advantages of automation include:
* enabling more replicates leading to improved statistical confidence
* improving replicability between researchers
* reduced repetitive stress for reseachers

And I'm Rikke, the latest member of the team.
